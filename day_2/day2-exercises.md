1. The differences between ordered, unordered, and definition lists are ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered and need to be completed starting with number one and ending with the last number. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point and do not need to be performed in any kind of order, hence the "unordered". Definition lists are made up of terms along with their definitions, think about vocabulary lists.

2. The basic structure of an element used to link to another website starts off with the "a" element. You should be able to click on anything in between these tags, using the opening and closing tags of course. So, you start off with <a, then you specify the link of the page by using the href attribute, an equal sign, and then the link to the page in quotes, end this with a >, then write text in which the users will see and be able to click on, lastly write the closing tag with the "a" element.

3. The attribute that you need to include in a link to open a new tab is the href attribute. The value of this attribute is the page that you want people to go to when clicking on the link.

4. You link to a specific part of that same page by using an absolute URL. An absolute URL will start with the domain name for the site and will be followed by the path of the specific page you want your user to go too.
